# white_noise
White noise generator developed in C.

Whitenoise by definition contains all frequencies at a constant amplitude. 
To generate a white noise it is necessary to be able to generate a sequence a pseudo-random numbers in the range from [-1.0 .. 1.0) which are effectively distributed according to the standard uniform distribution.

**NOTE**:
First, and perhaps most important: be very, very suspicious of a 
system-supplied rand(). System-supplied rand()s are almost always 
linear congruential generators that will eventually repeat itself,
with a period.

That's why we need a better pseudo-random numbers generator. The white noise generator will use `randq.c` a better way to generate a random number. We will use the "Quick and Dirty" Generators, described in "Numerical Recipes in C" Second Edition at page 284, relies on 32-bit arithmetic and developed in `randq.c` through the following functions: `srandqd`, `randqd_uint32` and `randq_double`;


## Stack
- [randq.c](https://github.com/alessandrocuda/randq): a better pseudo-random numbers generator
- [Portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/): audio I/O library
