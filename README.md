# noise_generator
Noise generator developed in C, allow to play in backgroun White and Brown noise.

 - ## White Noise

    Whitenoise by definition contains all frequencies at a constant amplitude. To generate a white noise it is necessary to be able to generate a sequence a pseudo-random numbers in the range from [-1.0 .. 1.0) which are effectively distributed according to the standard uniform distribution.

    **NOTE**:
    First, and perhaps most important: be very, very suspicious of a 
    system-supplied rand(). System-supplied rand()s are almost always 
    linear congruential generators that will eventually repeat itself,
    with a period.

    That's why we need a better pseudo-random numbers generator. The white noise generator will use `randq.c` a better way to generate a random number. We will use the "Quick and Dirty" Generators, described in "Numerical Recipes in C" Second Edition at page 284, relies on 32-bit arithmetic and developed in `randq.c` through the following functions: `srandqd`, `randqd_uint32` and `randq_double`;

 - ## Brown Noise

    White noise + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Simple_infinite_impulse_response_filter" target="_blank">digital low-pass filter</a> 

    **Digital Low-pass filter:**

    assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by Delta_T time. Let the samples of v_in **(the white noise)** be represented by the sequence (x_1,  x_2, ..., x_n), and let v_out **(brown noise)** be represented by the sequence (y_1, y_2, ..., y_n), which correspond to the same points in time.

    >therefore, to obtain the brown noise sequence it is sufficient to apply this equation to the white noise sequence.
