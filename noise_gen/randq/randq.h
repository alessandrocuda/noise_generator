*********************************************************************
*             A better way to generate a random number              *
*********************************************************************
*
*   PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generators):
*   First, and perhaps most important: be very, very suspicious of a 
*   system-supplied rand(). System-supplied rand()s are almost always 
*   linear congruential generators that will eventually repeat itself,
*   with a period.
*   So, never use the built-in generators in the C and C++ languages, 
*   especially rand  and srand. These have no standard implementation 
*   and are often badly flawed.
*   
*   This Library provides two  better way to generate a random number:
*       -   The "suspenders-and-belt,full-body-armor, never-any-doubt"
*           generator  laying on 64bit and respect all the constraints
*           defined in "Numerical Recipes" Third Edition at page 342.
*           The period of the generator is 3.138*10^57.
*           Function are: srandq64, randq64_uint64, randq64_uint32,
*                         and randq64_double;
*
*       -   the "Quick and Dirty" Generators laying on 32bit defined in
*           "Numerical Recipes in C" Second Edition. Use it only in very
*           special cases, where speed is critical and if you donâ€™t need
*           a period longer than 2^32.
*           Function are: srandqd, randqd_uint32 and randq_double;
*
